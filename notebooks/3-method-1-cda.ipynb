Results**:\n","1. **Bias (−s_DIS flipped)**: Bias reduction is strongest for gender (ambig ≈ 0.397, disambig ≈ 0.299), moderate for age (≈ 0.326 / 0.254), and lowest for race (≈ 0.268 / 0.230). Higher bars mean fewer biased A/B picks among non-UNKNOWN answers, so the model mitigates gender bias most and race least.\n","2. **Ambiguous vs disambiguous pattern**: For every bias type, ambig slices have better (higher) −s_DIS than disambig. This is consistent with the policy that with ambiguous questions the model can answer UNKNOWN more often, lowering biased A/B selections among the remaining non-UNKNOWN cases (reflected in negative s_amb values, strongest for gender: −0.377).\n","3. **AURC (disambig only)**: Selective risk is worst for gender at about 0.440, while age (~0.403) and race (~0.404) are lower (better). Practically, the model’s confidence ranking over disambig items is less reliable on gender questions.\n","4. 4.**Accuracy by slice**: Disambig accuracy is ~50% across the board (age 0.509, gender 0.504, race 0.497)—roughly coin-flip without calibration. Ambig accuracy is lower by design because “correct” means predicting UNKNOWN (age 0.242, gender 0.051, race 0.359), with gender ambig particularly hard."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[{"datasetId":8639930,"sourceId":13597290,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31154,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.12.0 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"f1062708a37074d70712b695aadee582e0b0b9f95f45576b5521424137d05fec"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
